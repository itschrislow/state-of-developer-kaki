        This is the first release of the state of DeveloperKaki and I plan to
        continue working on this project every year. As this is currently a
        1-man team, there are some time limitations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, the following are 3 key improvements I would like to integrate
        for the next year:
      </p>
      <ul className="mt-5 lg:mt-0 ml-4 list-disc list-outside">
        <li>Increase survey questions focused on technical aspects</li>
        <li>Improve outreach to larger and diverse group of developers</li>
        <li>Deeper insights and breakdown of data through charts and trends</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
